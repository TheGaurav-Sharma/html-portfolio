<h1>Best Movies according to me(Gaurav)</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>

<p>This movie teaches us the real meaning of education,life and friends.<br />
My favourite dialogue in it is "Kaamyab hone k liye mat padho. Kaabil bano, Kaamyaabi jhak maarke pichhe aegi."</p>

<h3>Chhichhore</h3>

<p>Movie "Chhichhore" taught me that,"we should not only think about success, but also what to do if have to face failure"</p>

<h3>Dil Bechara & Salaam Venky</h3>

<p>It emphasizes the audience(us) to live our lives to the fullest coz no one knows, when it'll be our last day in the world.</p>
